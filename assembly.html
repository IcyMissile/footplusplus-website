                    <p> Place the printed circuit board <sup style="color:red"> 1 </sup> into the housing box <sup> 2 </sup> and pass the cables through the housing box holes, as demonstrated in the image below. Place the lid on the housing box and secure using the four screws <sup> 4 </sup>, until the box until it is tightly sealed.

                    <h3> Step 2 </h3>
                    <p> Wrap a strip of velcro slightly below your knee (fuzzy side on your leg). Make sure the strap is tight enough so that it won’t move, but not so tight that it will be uncomfortable or disrupt circulation. Cut the velcro strap at that length. </p>

                    <p> Cut a piece of velcro the length of the housing box and attach the adhesive side to the housing box (this will be used to attach the box to your knee strap):

            <h3> Before you begin the next few steps, make sure you <strong>THOROUGHLY READ THROUGH THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE TENS BOX</strong>. This is important for your safety while using the device. Once completed, continue. </h3>
            <div id =" stim-one">
                <h3> Step 1 </h3>
                <p> For the next few steps, it may be helpful to receive some assistance from a friend or family member (or anyone that is willing to help put this together). Remove the Velcro stap and attached housing box from your leg, so that there is nothing on your leg. Sit on a high chair or surface where your leg can freely hang without touching the ground, as shown below (pic needed). Ensure that the edge of the chair or surface ends approximalty 2 inches from the back of your knee (show in picture with lines and arrows). </p>
            </div>
            <div id ="stim-two">
                <h3> Step 2 </h3>
                <p> Next, grab the electrode pads form the TENS box. Try to extend and flex your ankle by pointing your toes up and down while keeping the rest of your leg still (see video). It’s OK if you have trouble doing this, just give it your best. You should see a muscle on the front and lateral side of your leg contract when you try and raise your toe. This muscle is called the tibialis anterior and it is the one we are going to try and aid! Place the electrode pads on the most prominent part of this muscle, one electrode above the other, but not touching, as shown below: </p>

            </div>
            <div id="stim-three">
                <h3> Step 3 </h3>
                <p> Once these are placed, grab your TENS device from the box and the cable that is in the TENS box (see picture below for reference). Make sure the device is turned off. Connect this cable to the TENS device and to the two pads you placed on your muscle. The red and black ends of the cable go into the electrode pads (it does not matter which color you connect to which pad). The other end is plugged into the top of the TENS device. Open your TENS manual for more instructions on this if you are still having trouble. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="stim-four">
                <h3> Step 4 </h3>
                <p> With your foot relaxed still dangling, turn on the TENS device and SLOWLY adjust the settings on the TENS device to send the electrical impulses to your muscle. As depicted in the TENS manuals, this is done by turning the knob on the top of the TENS device next to the cable you connected. This knob controls the intensity of the electricity to be sent, so it is important to adjust this slowly to make sure you increment the electricity slowly. The goal is to make your foot lift up to a point that seems to be a natural foot lift. Once you notice that your foot has begun to lift, increase the intensity until you reach a point where your foot can no longer lift any higher - this is your optimal foot lift for walking. You must also be comfortable with the feeling that the electrical stimulation is sending to your body. With these devices, it is common to feel a bit of a tingling sensation when the device is on. If the electricity being sent to your leg is too uncomfortable, turn it down a bit. It's ok if your foot is not at the full lift, as long as it is lifting. Write down or save the settings you used somewhere you can reference it again, and turn the TENS device OFF. Remove the cable from the device and the pads, but keep the pads on your muscle. </p>
                <br>
                <p> It is very helpful to practice using the TENS device so you get familiar with its settings and power. Practice with this device can mean placing it on your muscle, reading the TENS manual to understand how to adjust specific settings, and finding the optimal setting for <strong> yourself </strong>. For reference, the most commonly used settings to stimulate the muscle are: FULL pulse width, 20-30Hz Pulse Rate, and a max intensity of 4. <br> If your foot is not lifting, make sure the electrodes are correctly placed. </p>

            </div>
            <div id="stim-five">
                <h3> Step 5 </h3>
                <p> You are now ready to use the device! Keep the pads on your muscle, and remove the cable from the pads and from the device. Now, re-attach the velcro-strapped device from earlier in the same location as before. Use the cables coming out of the box, and attach it to the pads, and to the TENS Device. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="stim-six">
                <h3> Step 6 </h3>
                <p> Turn your TENS device back on, with the settings you noted from before - Don’t worry, you will only feel the stimulation when you start walking. Once on and all the cables are connected, you can start walking. 
                <br>
                Congratulations, and happy walking!
